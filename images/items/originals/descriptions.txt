4026  Quite relaxing.
4027  "Let those that would rule as Verdant Kings wear upon their brow horns sharpened with the wisdom of judgment and hang upon their chins a mighty symbol of their station."
4024  A coat of leaves, common amongst the Druids of Verodicia, worn now by Nature's own prophet.
4025  The avatar of Nature's Wrath may take whatever form he pleases. Choosing sometimes to appear as tree, other times as predator, or when it suits him as prey.
4022  "No business but war. No family but death. No mercy but the grave!"
4023  "Let the carnage begin."
4020  A weapon of timeless rage.
4021  "So many skulls to cleave. So many bodies to throw on the pile."
4028  A set of horns worthy of a king.
4029  Wrapped in the power of the ancient woods.

4686  Heavy with the gifts granted by the plagued nobility, Rotund'jere had this frightening tool fashioned to remind those in his care of the ever-present likelihood of their demise.
4931  Even creatures of the twilight can scarcely see the wearer of this shawl.
4684  Bound with rope and made of simple fabrics, this dress burns with Nothl strength.
4933  Emblazoned with the Crepuscular Sigil, this crest draws darkness over its wearer.
4682  The elders grant this cloak only to the most skilled of the Dezun Order.
4683  To raise an arm wrapped in such a holy garment is to channel the most ancient knowledge of the Nothl Realm.
4732  When Ostarion came to conquer, this blade was presented as a gift in hope of negotiating a peaceful surrender.  It didn't work.
4733  "You don't get this good at butchery without spending a bit of time on a farm."
4730  Direstone is said to be lightweight and easy to counterbalance, making it perfect for a reaper.
4731  Ever it glows with heat and power, a blade of warmth in the darkness, a beacon of strength on the field.
4736  As luck would have it, this enchanted cudgel was just lying there in an exploding volcano Aggron happened to have stumbled in to.
4737  Doom's loins are girded in thickest demonhide and steel.
4734  'Thought it was time to try me out a new look.  What you think?'
4735  In the bounty hunting business, a little intimidation can go a long way.
4738  Heavy is the head that wears the horns of the Apocalypse.
4739  As old as the Tahlin Dynasty itself, this dagger has loosed blood in both war and peacetime.

4813  When it comes to dazzling fetishes, the Father Spirit knows best.
4812  There are many ways to reach the Nothl realm, several of which involve hits from the Great Pipe. Some hits are less survivable than others.
4811  Fashioned from the feathers of the violet shryll, a bird that flies with its wingtips trailing through the Nothl realm, while the rest of its body sails in the light of this world. 
4810  The wind can only keep so much hair back.
4817  A few dips into the wilds of Yama Raskav will bring out the brigand in anyone.
4816  You'll be glad you have this when the rainy season comes around.
4815  It'll take more than a rope to tame the wilds of Yama Raskav.
4814  What does Dazzle wear under his ritual skirt? That depends upon the ritual.
4819  When the energies of creation are hot and malleable, Skitskurr's carapace responds in kind, alerting him that it is time to start weaving.
4818  A little sweeter to some, a little meaner to the rest, you'd best be on this beauty's good side if you aim to keep your head.

20096 No Slithereen may fail. Though Slithice swam victorious at the battle of Crey, a single jeweled chalice was taken. The punishment for the lost bauble: banishment. So she wandered the deeps, bitterly searching for the chalice, and where once dwelt honor and humility now crept the tendrils of cruelty and malice. If she was to be exiled, then so be it. She shed the lighter tones of her ancestral armor, instead taking up darker armaments, and all who looked upon her felt the indomitable will of the exiled siren. This bundle contains all of the items in 'The Slithereen Exile' set for Naga Siren:

10098 Here's eyes in your ice!
4259  Many wonder what horrors inspired the shape of this mask.  Some believe it shows the back of some long-forgotten subterranean creature.  Others say it is the face of a demon.  Only Juggernaut knows for sure.
4258  Little else remains of Kunkka's helmsman.
4251  The shrunken skull of the warrior who killed the first Tale-Teller has found a special place of honor with all Tellers since.
4250  To wield a blade without a guard is to commit one's self to perfecting the art of combat.  Make but a single mistake, the slightest miscalculation, and life becomes forfeit.
4253  None know whose bones line mantle's fringe.  Every teller must ask unanswerable questions.
4252  Every generation has a seer to act as chronicler and teller of old tales.  As each one dies, a small handful of their bones are preserved and placed in the drum so that their spirit might infuse the telling of old tales.  Though the drum itself has been replaced many times, the oldest bones within are hundreds of years old.
4255  With the right wind behind it, even the Blueheart Glacier itself can be made to travel.
4254  The rich stories of the tribe are considered too sacred to be seen spoken by a mortal mouth.
4257  The Veiled Sisters pride themselves on having blades that can pierce anything.
4256  The shark said it couldn't be touched. Tidehunter disagreed.
4521  Named in honor of her lost village, this bow is a reminder of the destructive power of the wind.

4383  Locked frozen in a glacier for a thousand years, this great staff was carved long ago in honor of the twin northern stars. 
4382  All the rites of Qaldin are done as dance, with each step prescribed and enacted in precise detail. A misstep can mean an age of misfortune. But Sand King has never put one crawler wrong.
4381  Behold! This ritual adornment celebrates the flawless power of the Djinn who first poured the Sentient Sand into a suit of magical armor. Flawless and mighty, like the Djinn itself, a thorax for only the most sacred of occasions.
4380  Ozh icha gluth ahm'sol!
4387  Nothing moves more quietly, nothing strikes harder, than this feathered prowler of the Nightsilver Woods!
4386  Nights are cold in the contested lands, but for some, not cold enough.  This frost-charmed cape keeps cold what the sun would warm.
4385  The guard is built from the shield and straps taken from the corpse of the Crimson Cut-throat.
4384  The contract for the head of the Crimson Cut-throat was one of the most difficult that Gondar had ever accepted.  It was only natural that he'd keep a few souvenirs.

4033  In waters as treacherous as those that surround the Trembling Isle, it is inevitable that even the most skilled captain sustain injury.
4032  A necklace of rare leviathan's teeth.
4035  Few would argue that keeping their thigh intact outweighs whatever discomfort this armor may cause.
4034  The tall, serrated shafts along the side are said to improve hearing for the wearer.
4037  Carefully constructed to guide a foe's blade away from the shoulder, or to catch it mid-swing.  Many have fallen overlooking such a simple piece of armor.
4036  The sheer size and weight of this piece were scoffed at until Sven used the shoulder spikes to impale an attacking ogre along the Feral Road.
4038  A single edged blade perfect for quickly removing heads. Or legs. Or arms.
4598  Strong, but light as a feather, this bow of the sparrowhawk will fly your arrows true to their targets.
4599  For a traveler from Claszureme, one's place in the flow of time is uncertain.  These runes help ground the wearer within time's march.

4725  A helm plucked from the battlefield, after a glorious victory over Cosang riders in the Desert of Misrule.
4724  Most observers of Alchemy fail to realize the importance of personal defense against most observers of Alchemy.
4727  Rule number one, always come prepared!
4726  Simple, elegant, ripped from a corpse.  The scap of banner taken from a Vigil Knight now makes a fine cape for a Keen.
4721  These blades were taken from the corpses of slain leviathans following the battle of Crey.
4720  All who dared stand against the Bramble Lord well knew how easily his powers could catch and pierce their lives.
4723  He that burns now wears bracers is forged in the cauldron of deepest hell.

4623  The first curse, the curse of flame, lain upon his sword.
4624  The eleventh and final curse, the curse of wisdom, lain upon his horns.
4625  Drow has nothing to learn from the Sylvan Guard, but from time to time she relieves one of them of their bow, that she might test its quality. Even by her standards, this one is adjudged very fine.
4626  Stealth is of utmost importance to those who number themselves among the Sylvan Guard. Even Drow finds this an acceptable cape for moving unseen through the wooded ways.
4627  The sixth curse, the curse of fortitude, lain upon his wrists.
4628  While not a member of the Sylvan Guard, Drow spies upon them in their marches, and occasionally admires their passing fashions.
4629  The archers of the Sylvan Guard shoot only arrows crafted specifically for their use. When Drow uses their gear, such arrows are de rigeur.

4538  A Gauntlet as strong as faith itself, and as protective as the loving embrace of the Omniscient.
4539  As the comet fell, the power of Morphling crested. Perfect for slicing through enemies as you shoulder them aside.
4828  Those who worship the Solar Goddess of the eastern wastes are known for the skill forging gold.
4829  The artisans of the eastern wastes are known for their ability to wrap golden beauty within sharpened practicality.
4826  The heat of the eastern wastes is said to be extraordinary.  One must cover themselves appropriately.
4827  To hide in the burning bright sun is no easy task.  It requires planning, luck, and the right color armor.
4824  Sange, one of the two legendary moonblades, is said to be unnaturally accurate and able to change to a form that best fits the fighting style of its owner. In the hands of Riki the weapon becomes a small dagger.
4825  Rubick's foray into the often confused politics of magicians is greatly aided by this enchanted third eye. At least, that's what he claims.
4822  Skitskurr senses are finely tuned to the slightest disruption of the fabric of creation.

10155 A strange and fragrant chest. The lock is of an unknown design and the contents are currently a mystery.
20087 In hushed tones, legends have long been whispered of the near-mythical stormcrows. Enormous, powerful and reclusive, these strange, scarce birds range across the highest peaks of the Prefect mountains, hidden from the world by a constant bank of dark cloud. Their rare sighting are considered ill omens, said to portend of storms soon to follow. Legends also tell of those few who have dared face the dangerous trials required to harness the power of these creatures for themselves.  For the only way to return after stealing the egg of a stormcrow - a potent source of power - is to wrestle control of one of the enormous black birds and ride it down to the ground, miles below.  Includes all of the items in 'The Stormcrow's Spirit' set for Witch Doctor:
20086 Trinkets and tall tales are just a few of the ways a drifter can make a living out in Riftshadow, but there's a lot more in the waste if you know how to look, and where. You'll want a guide and someone who knows their way in a fight, that should let you scratch the surface and take in some history. Getting rich from the ruins though, that's another matter. If you want to learn Riftshadow's darkest secrets, you better tip well and know how to keep your mouth shut. This here bundle includes all of the items in 'The Riftshadow Roamer' set for Meepo:
10158 Is it a clever chameleon pretending to be a powerful Wyrm, or a celebrated Wyrm trying to pass itself off as an anonymous chameleon? Truly, the dimensions have begun to spill into each other, and nothing may be taken for granted. Especially not Wynchell.
10159 The taming of a grillhound is a tale filled with trials and breakthroughs, and more than a few singed eyebrows.

20080 Includes all of the items in 'The Mage Slayer' set for Anti-Mage:
4655  The elements used in this mask's construction are able to deflect most spells, just as its shape may divert a blade.
4654  Brutality defined many of the early weapons used by the Anti-Mage.
4657  The last person to call these weapons primitive ended up wearing one in his skull.
4656  Heavy is the burden shouldered by the Beastmaster, and strong is the mantle that supports him.
4651  Those whom the Anti-Mage hunts may be as skilled with a sword as they are with a spell, and so this collar was crafted to turn their blades aside.
4650  In an age when fear surrounded sorcery, tales told of an oppressive wizard capable of limitless destruction.
4653  Time and practice would persuade the Anti-Mage against such a heavy garment, yet its use in combat has not diminished.
4652  These bracers are made to defend against both swords and sorcery.

4282  Infused with strength glacial ice, Tiny has the power to scour his enemies from the battlefield.
4283  With the Army of Red Mist now a bloody heap, the Bloodmist Army rises to fill the void.
4280  Lost for centuries, the winged axe known as Sylnashar was once the favored weapon of an ancient king.
4281  Not the actual shoulders of a dragon, but a skilled artist's rendition of it.
4286  These pauldrons were once owned by a mighty officer of the Bloodmist Army.  Axe is only too pleased to tell the tale of their encounter.
4287  Sven seemed overcome with nostalgia at the sight of this sword, though he would not say why.
4284  This helm sits heavily on the head to strengthen the neck below.
4285  Where the Army of Red Mist trained to aim for the neck, the Bloodmist prefer to aim for the belly.
4288  What it may lack in weight, it makes up for in finesse.

4758  It takes a truly special bow to be wielded by fingers of flame.
4759  "Ah, flesh meat!"
4750  Eight legs of armor, each hammered from the breastplate of a fallen knight.
4751  With shaking hands, the doomed blacksmith laid a crown upon the spider's head, saying, "A crown fit for a queen."
4752  Strong though her natural chitinous armor may be, there is something about the caress of steel against her carapice that privides a special sense of security for the Brood Queen.
4753  The acolytes of the Solar Goddess said Lina's hair was "touched by the light", and so gifted her with trinkets made to reflect the warming love of the sun.
4754  During her training in the flame arts, Lina chose to travel east to study with the followers of the Solar Goddess.
4755  The heat of the eastern wastes is said to be extraordinary.  One must dress appropriately.
4756  It is said that in a moment of divine inspiration the Solar Goddess herself visited Lina to bless her with power, and grant her this gift.
4757  The perfect accoutrement for when Lina wishes to "Mix things up a bit." Which is almost always.
4633  The other blade was just for show.
4632  It must be admitted: Drow admires the Sylvan Guard. When from time to time she puts on their gear, and pretends to adopt their ways, she can hardly suppress her joy in having an excuse to don this stylish armor.
4631  The second curse, the curse of the fallen, is lain upon his wings.
4630  In her youth, Drow was tempted once or twice to throw over her lonely ways and join the Sylvan Guard. These cuffs were a large part of the attraction.
4634  A belt of cursed power.  Would that the navel of the world were so protected.

4839  The coil along the staff allows the caster to embellish the course of whatever energies it may release.
4838  Channeling the arcane and odd, the fearsome and strange, often requires implements both unexpected and unwieldy.
4528  "Don't worry, precious Axe. Blink Dagger does not come to chop."
4831   Made of finest rumble-hide, this low-hanging quiver of feathery arrows is ready for action!
4526  In the Red Mist army, cowards were made to cut their hair in shame.  Axe has known neither fear, nor shame.  Nor a barber.
4833  Hair tied up and out of the way, she tops it off with a feathery headscarf for a breezy, carefree, I-just-shot-you-in-the-face look.
4832  Designed to camouflage her outline and confuse attackers, these shoulders of tough harpy feathers offer protection against whirling blades.  This is sure to turn some heads.
4523  Doom's power has shattered this blade.
4834  A breezy, flowing cloak is just what one needs to look good on a hunting trip.  Particularly if your prey might be hunting you right back.
4837  While not as sturdy as a proper dueling mask, this covering is better tuned to project words of power.
4520  Named after her village that was destroyed in a storm long ago, this cape is a reminder that wind can protect as well as destroy.

4189  'Ouch!'
4188  Gold is only one reason why Gondar hunts.
4181  The time-altering properties of chronite stabilizes the Faceless Void's presence in the material realm.
4180  Short in size, but long on killing power, this little bow is an ideal weapon for dispatching overconfident enemies.
4183  A symbol of power within the infinite halls of Claszureme.
4182  A pair of chronite encrusted bracers that seem to warn the Faceless Void of his enemies' future attacks.
4185  Despite their size, these sharp ice-like crystals weigh almost nothing and so do not hinder the Drow Ranger's use of the bow.
4184  The Faceless Void has known many forms, his body twisted by the nameless forces that whorl and eddy within the time streams.
4187  None would say that Gondar the Bounty Hunter does not take pleasure in his work.
4186  Light plate greaves decorated with sharp crystal spikes. These are designed to provide protection without inhibiting movement.

4349  Among the Brewmasters of Oyo diligent drunkenness is the only path to enlightenment.
4348  Although unknown to the land-based historians of terrestrial empires, the mythologies of sea-dwelling creatures oft look to the moon and stars for wisdom and guidance.
4347  The runes along the edge prevent it from being enchanted by those that may seek to disarm the wielder.
4346  To grip such a weapon is to maintain one's hold on reality.
4345  In the hands of one, the uses of this lance are few.  In the hands of many, however...
4344  With five Meepos you've got quite the band.
4343  But does Yurnero ever smile beneath the mask?
4342  A skilled warrior wielding this sword can tell the type of blade he faces by the sound it makes when they clash.
4341  A rare but useful mutation. The spikes are actually malformed teeth that grew out of place, and well out of hand.
4340  When visions of Death bring a chill, this scarf keeps Death Prophet warm. Then again, she enjoys a little chill.
13    Omniknight's old bracers
4761  Cleave fast, die young, and leave an imperishable corpse!
4760  A few quick turns under Pudge's Tenderizer, and even the toughest foe goes down like butter.
4763  Disruptor had his eye on Grull from the moment he spotted the beast standing in the corner of the breeder's yard. "Who's that one then?" "Grull. None can ride her. She's too disruptive." "Perfect! I'll ride her home!" 
4762  When Sven stands his ground, this blade stands with him.
4765  No mere clam-splitter, this.  Kunkk wields a fine blade of strongest steel, able to pierce Kraken hide. 
4764  Though doom and ruin they saw, the visions of the haruspex brought to Sylla a sense of destined calm. During mediations, he found his spiritual projections altered to appear less intimidating.
4767  Many a storm has sluiced down upon these broad shoulders, now protected from the stormy seas by this stylish all-weather gear.
4766  Rain, nor waves, nor driving wind can chill Kunkka's head while he's wearing this noble cowl.
4769  The fashions of Yoskreth are not common in much of the rest of the world.
4768  Make no mistake, Kunkka is a salty old sailor not to be underestimated.  If he wears puffy cuffs, it's because he has something up his sleeve.
4167  The twinblade is designed to provide balance and flexibility in combat. The user can strike enemies quickly and at unexpected angles.
4166  Twin-frost orbs charge this bow with arcane energy.
4165  It is ever the warrior's charge to keep anger in check.  In the heat of battle, however, controlling emotions are the least of one's concerns.
4164  The work of the Axe is grim and endless.
4163  Those who deny the strength of the Axe soon find a worthy place from which to witness his deeds.
4162  A heavy woolen cloak dyed black. It could make even Axe seem stealthy.
4161  A blood spattered and heavily notched blade. It has seen much use.
4160  An exceptional specimen, surely the Captain's first pick of the loot. The hilt is dressed in worked gold and exotic stones. The blade blessed with a strangely glowing enchantment.
4169  This shuriken's blades are clean and sharp, a weapon fresh and ready.
4168  A solidly built hammer, inscribed with the names of the Holy Hierophants and imbued with the might of the Omniscience.

4571  When a heavy silence falls, Nortrom will need mighty shoulders such as these to bear up under its weight.
4572  With this three-bladed glaive, Nortrom ensures a silence that will never be broken.
4573  These blades were taken from the corpses of slain leviathans following the battle of Crey.
4574  As if knowing the destiny that awaited it, the comet that once carried Morphling from the heavens produced from its own substance a pair of armlets that would one day fit its passenger perfectly.
4575  To wield such a prized spear, one must have courage and ferocity befitting the honors of the Golden Mane.
4576  To gain the honors of the Golden Mane, one must endure incredible sacrifice.
4577  In each ferocious face is set determination without fear.  Such is required from those who would don the honors of the Golden Mane.
4578  Stripped of her rank and station, the exile Slithice has been instructed to cover her headfin while among her people.
4579  Fashioned in the forge of an undersea volcano, the obsidian plating was a given to Slithice as a gift from the grateful denizens of Crey.

4888  With his head shaved to better commune with the minds of his animal brothers, Beastmaster is prepared for any battle.
4889  A thick, protective vest of finest pantheran hide.  
4880  From a race of dragons that normally patrols the dark side of the moon, Ormr wanted to see the world.
4881  Able to see a tic on a mouse's back at a thousand paces, Sniper's Spottin' Goggles are a marvel to behold.
4882  In Dark Reef Prison, Slark kept too low a profile to ever be called a trendsetter. He figured nobody noticed his radical look. But as soon as he had broken out, the remaining inmates began to imitate this finny style. 
4883  Few know that Rubick's talents for mimicry extend to arcane assembly.
4884  What good is a battle without a banner to celebrate it?  No good at all, or so says the Juggernaut.
4885  Worn in remembrance of his time in the stocks.  These bracers are both a symbol of his bondage, and a promise that he will never again serve nobility.
4886  Even his axes are trained.
4887  Woven from the pelt of a fallen pantheran, this belt is s symbol of the Beastmaster's strength.
4408  Recycled from scraps of old wine casks, this quiver is the ultimate in green construction.
4409  A belt handed down through generations; the meaning of the sigil at its center has been lost to time.
4404  Morphling emulates the eternal patterns of Polymorphia in all he does. And by this crown, he marks himself a master of the art.
4405  The sigil of Saberhorn's army is carved into the shoulder.
4406  This belt once belonged to Saberhorn, a legendary general from a bygone era.
4407  The legendary general Saberhorn was said to have been able to end any duel with a single swing.
4400  A gilded keepsake from her first assassination, this heirloom once graced the flowing locks of Queens.  Now Templar Assassin wears it as reminder that no one is beyond her reach.
4401  A traditional hakama from Isle of Masks. It was given to Yurnero by his late swordmaster, long before his exile.
4402  This heirloom is old and cracked, yet for Azwraith it smells of home.
4403  The power of Polymorphia is but barely contained between these splendid crests, and takes its most awe-inspiring form in the shape of their devoted wearer, Morphling.

15011 Frostivus is no time to be caught out in the cold. Let a warming fire melt the chill away from you and your friends.Only usable during Frostivus.

4372  This weapon once adorned a nobleman's mantel collecting dust, which is exactly the fate Axe made for the nobleman's head.
4373  Direstone is not a substance to be worn lightly. When Morphling dons these bracers, he means business.
4370  Forged from the finest dragon's gold, these vambraces are a bargain at any price.
4371  While the edge has cracked and chipped on the lives of hundreds, it has never failed to finish the job.
4376  The helm of the legendary general Saberhorn has seen countless battles and wars.
4377  Izhai icha ensh safras!
4374  Lacking flesh, Clinkz adorns his skeletal hand with the claw of the Vandal.  Forged by smeevils in ages long past, this iron claw is for many hapless victims the iron grip of death itself.
4375  If it was good enough to cut the heart from a heretic, then it is good enough to cut the heart from anyone.
4830  Few assassins would dare use with such a finely wrought implement in combat, yet to the skilled this blade offers balance and sharpness more than equal to any task.
4080  The aspect of the high plains ram imbues its bearer with the endurance of mountains.
4081  A warrior that slays the wolf with open handed strikes may bear its aspect into war as a symbol of courage and tenacity.
4082  A set of serviceable bracers, made from the mighty mountain wolf.
4083  "In the grip, the left hand must know Ardent Volition and the right hand must know Cultivated Grace. In this way the strike that follows bears both intentionality and respect. It is only the brute who strikes without these considerations."
4084  Does this beard represent the brutal cycle of life in the wild? Or is it tied back simply to prevent it from getting in the way of one's mayhem? Perhaps it holds both a symbol and a purpose.
4085  Glory to her that brings the wind and upon it life's essence!
4086  While lesser druids draw upon blood and mana to work their arts, Nature's Prophet taps directly the heart of Verodicia's wrathsome will.
4087  The men of the deep forest are not like their milk-fed cousins. Primal, driven by instinct and a will to survive, they call upon nature's pantheon and know nothing of gentle gods.
4088  Two sigils that bear the signs of an Elder Ecology.
4089  Even for the Avatars of Immortals modesty is sometimes called for.
4691  Draped in the dark magic of a fabric as sheer as the new moon's faintest rays, Mirana glides silently through the dark.
4690  Even in the dark of a moonless night, Mirana shall not fumble for an arrow when she carries the Nightsilver Quiver.
4693  Just as the moon appears to greatest advantage in the darkest skies, Mirana's tresses shine most softly in the Nightsilver Woods.
4692  Bearing a gem that reflects the brightness of the Demon Star between the moon's horns, Mirana knows no fear.
4798  When the science of Alchemy requires hacking your way through a mob of angry villagers, accept nothing less.
4799  Just because you're in a battle is no reason not to practice proper lab safety!
4794  It has often been said that Lina's hair was touched by fire, though few know the truth of this claim.  In Lina's youth, as her natural talents first began to smoke and smolder it was her fiery hair that told the tale of the storm to come.  With time and training, her skill and control of the flame was enough to suppress the searing display.  Yet on occasion, when her ire grows and tempers flare, the full measure of Lina's burning spirit threatens to unleash its wrath.
4795  Each Nyx Assassin's third kill is marked with the bestowing of this great horn--a ceremonial piece that must be blooded repeatedly if it is to be retained.
4796  When the new Nyx Assassin is chosen, he is sent to the Hidden Hive for confirmation. These claws connote completion of the Assassin's first assignment. 
4797  Only those who preside in the Hidden Hive and share in the schemes of the goddess Nyx know the true significance of this ceremonial armor.
4790  Woven from the finest, tight-knitted fabrics, this heavy chest-piece protects from both the elements and errant blades.
4791  These hardy, salt-toughened boots provide firm footing whether striding a heaving deck, or a blood-soaked battlefield.
4792  A Sash of rarest spider silk, the parting gift of a long ago princess from the isle of Songs.
4793  Why carry your bullets in a bag when you can slot them into your bracers for quick reloading?
4152  These fine pantaloons show that Sven's travels have led him into gold as much as glory.
4153  "Bitter the orphans journey--and lonely the orphan's grave."
4150  This old gladiatorial helm serves Sven well as he travels the land in search of honor and gold.
4151  Rogue swordmasters must balance the need for protection with the need for speed. This pauldron protects Sven's leading shoulder, but leaves his back arm unencumbered.
4156  Someone has taken the sail of a pirate ship and crudely sewn it into a mockery of a pirate's tricorn.
4157  Envious of Dark Seer's pointed skull, Faceless Void channels the fabric of the Rift to focus not only his intellect, but his entire "head."
4154  Dragonmaw is mighty even among the Named Swords. It's jagged teeth rip at even the strongest hides, laying bear the vulnerable flesh beneath.
4155  A gigantic bracer made from bits of sail and tied with line.
4158  A rather oversized, stuffed squid plushie. He's cute and slimy and his name is Squiddles.
4159  A staff bearing an array of spectrolite mana focusing crystals set in gold.

20145 By the blinding light of the blood moon, these items transform Lycan into the ultimate killing beast.  Includes all of the items in the 'Sanguine Moon' set for Lycanthrope:
4563  Whatever magic his enemies use, whatever spells his foes may cast in his direction, bounce soundlessly off this shield of silence.
4562  Like the angvols of old legends, these golden falcon wings speed Windrunner's flight into battle.
4561  A beautiful quiver of the finest polished bloodwood.
4560  Winged armor worthy of a knight in the great Omniscient's army.
4567  Silence is golden, as is the point on this mighty helm.
4565  These bracers bespeak a man who will brook no magical manipulations!
4564  Constructed from the scales of a fallen wyvern, this shoulder armor is a mark of distinction for any knight.
4569  No one wears this robe with quite the grandeur and majesty of Silencer. But if they do, no one will ever hear about it.
4568  Once thought to be a mythical beast, Windrunner slew the elusive, green oyoloe, and made a bow from its antlers.
20142 This bundle contains all of the items in the 'Inscrutable Zeal' set for Rubick:
4899  A weapon shimmering with the violent energy from Spectre's home plane of existence.
4898  The charmed ropes that once bound him should have rotted away, but Lich has preserved them as reminder to all that no power in creation can hope to hold him.
20143 This bundle contains all of the items in the 'Hunter in Distant Sands' set for Bounty Hunter:
4893  When you're in your cups, this mailed skirt has your back.
4892  Designed from the cast-off remnants of ancient brew casks, these bits of aged wood have been infused with the essence of the ancient order of the Oyo.
4891  The ancient order of the Oyo binds the sword arm of each young apprentice as a symbol of commitment to their forebears.
4890  Drink from this jug and you will experience enlightenment.  Or forget why you were striving for it.
4897  The ice mage's robes became the Lich's tattered shroud. Superstitious subjects hammered spikes of sacred metal as a warning into the dead mage's skull, none suspecting that upon his resurrection he would wear the device as a cursed crown of domination. 
4896  Drowned but not dead, deep in the Black Pool, the cold hatred in Lich's heart froze the water around him. These ice-shards, formed of evil, hold a hatred that will never melt.
4895  They sank Ethrain into the Black Pool with a weighted belt; but gravity has no pull on the Lich in his resurrected form. He wears the belt now as a mockery. And they say that all the warmth of his former heart resides in that pulsing flask, where he can keep a cold eye on it.
4894  Did I say word?  I meant sword.  Sword of the Drunken Warlord.  There are words on it.
20141 This bundle contains all of the items in the 'Twisted Wisdom' set for Leshrac:
20146 This bundle contains all of the items in the 'Ancestors' Pride' set for Phantom Lancer:
20147 Includes all of the items in the 'Dead Winter' set for Lich:
20144 Arrows of a feather flock together. Constructed from strong and resilient harpy feathers, this set of Featherfall is a fine upgrade to Windrunner's look.  This bundle contains all of the items in the 'Featherfall' set for Windrunner.
4419  Although some travelling shaman have been rightly accused of selling colored water as if it were a certain cure for all ills, Rhasta makes no such claims and has never charged so much as a pence for a swig from this bottle. In fact, no one but Rhasta may drink from it. The Shadow Shaman's brew is certain death to anyone but its maker.
4418  Beneath her secret glades, Drow found a passage lit by crystal shards. Following the glittering light to the farthest cavern, she discovered this bow, embedded in the rock as if it had formed there.
4417  "A shaman must take good care of his skin!" Rhasta's master instructed. "Therefore, always wear a hat to keep off the sun, and no less the evil influence of the moon." And then the old man always broke into laughter. "And if you believe that, I have a bag of herbs here that will confer infinite wealth and immortality."
4416  A final twist of the serpent completes Rhasta's disguise, in case he is travelling incognito. It must be admitted that sometimes he wields it just because he likes the companionship.
4415  A helm of great beauty and strength, the Runed Helm of Valor is armor worthy of the Omniknight.
4414  It may not save their souls, but this hammer will surely send your enemies to their just reward.
4413  Prove your chivalry by smashing enemies in the face with this powerful weapon.
4412  His old master said, "Be clear what you are about, for these simple village folk read menace and evil intent into poor communication." Therefore Rhasta created a simple visual menu of the services he offers, and wears it in plain sight.
4411  A traditional sleeveless jacket worn by the great warriors of Isle of Masks. It carries the banner of Yurnero.
4410  Water, they say, has a memory--but Morphling's dissolves with every form he takes. These pauldrons serve as a reminder of his original being, rooted in Polymorphia.
4900  Energy from Spectre's home plane of existence pulses through her wings, nearly overtaking her physical form.
4960  With this jewel upon your brow, the future will be one of great victory.

4365  In the endless chill of the far north, it is said that the cold of death comes on a howling wind brought by a great white wolf.  Many a hunter has attempted to slay this grave spirit.  Yet in all the known histories, the stories record only one bow that has ever fired strong enough, and true enough, to pierce its side.
4364  No mere woodcutter's hatchet, the Wyvernguard Edge is a great-axe with the bite of a dragon.  Forged from the knights' steel found fused and glowing in the molten guts of a dozen slaughtered Pyrexae, the blade of Wyvernguard penetrates to the bleeding heart of any battle.
4367  A playful crop of spikes that says 'I'm killing you and having fun doing it.' Includes a frost-tinged cloak to complete the image.
4366  A cloak of scintillating frost.
4361  The Bear Clan taught that every rising sun was a gift, and so appointed one among them to greet the dawn each day.
4360  If you ask Aggron, they won it in a dice game.  If you ask its former owner, you'll get the silence of the grave.
4363  Recluse Reef is known for treacherous currents, lacerating corals, and barnacles big enough to drag down a galleon. In these evil waters, one denizen glides without fear, the undisputed master of Recluse Reef. Or anyway he glided...until Tidehunter needed a flail.
4362  In the custom of the Bear Clan, each warrior must carry his newborn in a satchel on his shoulder for eleven full days to prove his strength.  On the twelfth day, armor is bestowed.  
4369  As the wave of Morphling crests, surging into battle, these Direstone crests come along for the ride.
4368  Sometimes you have to go with what you can find.
20151 Includes all of the items in the "Thousand Faces" set for Juggernaut:
4093  Is it trying to hitch a ride?  Is it trying to mate with his head?  Does it think it can influence the Tidehunter's thoughts?  Who knows!
4092  The great kraken tortoises are considered both a delicacy, and a worthy foe.  Their shells are highly prized as shelter or armor.
4091  "Below me trees unnumber'd rise, beautiful in various dyes; the gloomy pine, the poplar blue, the yellow beech, the sable-yew, the slender fir, that taper grows, the sturdy oak with broad-spread boughs..."
4096  The skulls of the Witch Doctor's tribal ancestors adorn this belt.
4095  The Dragon Knight bore this shield the day he fought and slew the Time Dragon Uldorak.
4094  "Ware the wanderer who walks with head held high, back unstooped, and arm held ready. The one that so boldly denies his disgrace has no such disgrace to deny! Surely that one is an assassin cloaked in contempt."
4099  A lord so adorned will bend the will of many.
4098  The greatest warrior stands between Ivory and Ebony, lending sword and hand but not heart or mind.
20150 This bundle contains all of the items in the 'Heavy Armor of the World Runner' set:
4585  To possess the power of a Demon Witch is to stand in defiance of powers seen and unseen.
4584  Defy the Omniscient, and the price will be this blade on your neck.  It is a heavy weapon, wielded with a heavy heart.
4587  As the threat from the outer dark mounts, the Harbinger intimidates these implacable forces with wings of strange power.
4586  Those who patrol the edge of the void must gird themselves in armor impregnable to evil's piercing rays.
4581  A helm of purest gold and sterling silver, created in honor of the Omniscient.
15012 Everyone loves a good support player and now you can provide support in wicked style with this  free gift from the DOTA 2 store!		Double-click or right-click this pack from your inventory to unpack a special collection of items for the Witch Doctor. 		This pack includes 3 items in the Wicked Bad Voodoo set: a new mask, a new staff, and a new back item.
4580  A glorious cape sewn by a hundred monks in honor of the Omniscient.
15013 When used, this Action Item gives a random item drop to up to 25 random players and spectators on the server (except you). You can use this item by equipping it as an action item and then activating it during a match.
4583  An ancient weapon from an unknown craftsman, it was said to have been forged for he whom destiny calls worthy. Each swing heralds another step toward a new age.
4582  Few facets of the utter foul wander the land unbidden. To claim such a skin is to declare primacy over the inferno.
15018 The Defense is the most prestigious Dota 2 online tournament held by joinDOTA, powered by Razer & BenQ. Featuring 20 hand-selected world-class teams and four community wildcard winners $10,000 prize money await only the toughest and most experienced of contestants on their way to the top.
4789  As light as a feather to the weilder.  The weight of a boulder to its target.
4788  Only the doomed, or doom's master, can carry this single fragment of absolutely pure, unalloyed, unsullied corruption.
4787  Fear not, this belt was crafted by Wildwing artisans from thousands of feathers plucked painlessly from living individuals; and not, as some have suggested, hacked from a dead Wildwing.
4786  Enchantress passes unchallenged through Wildwing territories when she wears this headdress.
4785  It is unfortunate that a few rogue Wildkin must spoil the proud race's reputation, but when it is time to hunt those few rascals down, Enchantress bears a spear granted her by the wisest of the Wildwing race.
4784  As the Anti-Mage grew in power and prestige, the sovereign of Yoskreth sought his services to topple the fearsome sorcerer Sahsk.
4783  A stygian tail of finest demon armor, forged in the fifth of the seven hells. 
4782  Fine cloth is combined with the silvered metals that make up the royal patterns of Yoskreth.
4781  With the defeat of Sahsk, the sovereign of Yoskreth granted the Anti-Mage tools befitting one of such power and skill.
4780  A cursed blade forged to slice through the membrane that separates the seven hells.
4149  A rather clumsy attempt at a weapon. The jaw of...something...has been lashed to a broken piece of mast.
4148  A sharp, cracked femur of some unidentifiable sea-beast.
4145  Even the best swimmer may be caught unaware.
4144  The wings symbolize the soaring heights of the cliffs of Emauracus, where it is said that the Omniscience itself may bless the pious with holy visions.
4147  There might still be a little meat on it.  But probably not.
4146  What ancient beast once wore this?  The Tidehunter cares not.
4141  Those who don these fabrics must swear never to fall in battle, for it is considered a sin to defile such a garment with earth.
4140  They are as pristine as the day they were made, but do not be fooled into thinking they have never seen combat.
4143  A dragon knight's shield is often more important than his sword. Dragons always strike first.
4142  Intended as an trophy for the most stalwart of the order's crusaders, the great smiths ensured it would be just as impressive above a hearth as it would be in combat.

4558  Axe never had the heart to wipe the original owner's blood from the edge.
4559  A helm of great strength and beauty, this armor of the gilden falcon offers a special kind of security, protecting both the wearer's head and identity.
4556  These dusty old blades find use once more.
4557  Werebat? There bat!
4554  This beautiful emrald cloak is embroidered with the ancient sidgel of the gilded falcon.
4555  These dusty old blades find use once more.
4552  An ancient bow of oak and iron, gilded with the golden feathers of a sacred falcon.
4553  As the diving bird of prey has talons, so the archer has arrows.  And many are the arrows that can be held in the quiver of the gilded falcon.  
4551  Death Prophet clearly has only one thing on her mind: Death. This armor holds her like a cold, bony embrace.
4620  The third curse, curse of the prehensile, lain upon his tail.
4428  Morphling spent eternities travelling space in the form of ice. Morphling knows ice. You know that if Morphling wears a crown of ice, it is a serious crown.
4429  The glitter of the interstellar ice that once bedizened Morphling, decks his shoulders now as he surges to and fro across the field of battle.
4422  In battle, these bracers, ever before Morphling's gaze, remind him of the power of Polymorphia.
4423  Keeping a pan handy will let you make noise and scare off the wildlife, or cook them if you're lucky.
4420  Hard as ice, but strong as steel, these bracers bring a chill to the heart of those who would oppose the maiden of the north. 
4421  An extra layer or two ought to be able turn back some teeth.
4426  This beautiful bow, modeled after the delicate and poisonous sun vine, is even more deadly than its namesake.
247   This new item has no description.
4424  This new item has no description.
4425  A ceremonial mask worn on special occasions. This must be a special occasion.
4958  A bridle of unbridled power!
246   This new item has no description.
4952  The Lion of the Moon cloaks its riders in magic and might.
241   This new item has no description.
4950  The power of the lunar lioness purrs  in this bow's enchanted string.
4951  An emblem of honor, worn with grace but never lightly.
4956  As wind and sand can wear down a mountain, so too this magical staff can wear down even the greatest foe.
4957  Of these 22 keys, one is the key to the final plane of existence.
4954  A braid with mystic stylings woven into it.
240   This new item has no description.

20139 This bundle contains the two moonblades, Sange and Yasha, for the stealth assassin Riki.
20138 This bundle contains all of the items in the 'Ritual Garb of the Father Spirits' set for Dazzle:
10028 What he lacks in size he makes up for in character.
10029 Team spirit!
10026 Don't let its metal form deceive you: this contraption is more magic than machine. Fashioned by the Mad Mage Morok who was far too lazy to carry his own spell books and far too cheap to retain hirlings.
10027 This imp has trained all his life for this moment. He is SO ready to go. He will deliver your loot on time or suffer eternal damnation in the sixty-four planes of the Lesser Hells.
10024 A friendly Tegu from the dragon infested Cathauran Wastes. He smiles as if he knows something you do not.
10025 This boar has a crazed look in his eye. Is it distrust? Madness? Or does he just want to eat your tangos.
10022 You will need a Treasure Key to open this chest. You can pick one up at the DOTA 2 Store. Each chest series comes with a different selection of possible loot.

4310  Designed to catch and hold the target, no matter which point is used.
4311  The forked tip allows the wielder to pry back any armor the target may be wearing.
4312  Forged in volcanic fire, bathed in the blood of countless foes, the Reaver is a weapon that has never known mercy.
4313  There is more to catching prey than merely stalking them through the woods.
4314  A Hierophant of the Omniscience must always approach with head bowed.
4315  A Hierophant of the Omniscience must always sense the power that protects him.
4316  A Hierophant of the Omniscience must always feel the weight of responsibility upon his shoulders.
4317  A Hierophant of the Omniscience must always heed the words of his order.
4318  A Hierophant of the Omniscience must always guard against any threat.
4319  Belched up from the hells beyond, the cursed Nightmare Blade is not of the mortal plane.  Whosoever dares to swing the sword in combat will find their dreams haunted by all whom the blade has cut down.
4228  Horns curved into a sigil of peace.
4229  Light and fluffy.
4224  It's supposed to be smiling.
4225  Not all of the Witch Doctor's enslaved spirits are ancestors. This household totem contains the trapped soul of a swamp dwelling Yando beast.
4226  A Candral-Flower plucked from the heart of the Endless Copse.
4227  Hung about the neck and worn during festive events, the garland is a universal symbol of friendship, peace, and good tidings.
4220  A carefully crafted soul-trap, adorned with the skull of a previous victim.
4221  The life essence of a sacrificial totem beast imbues this ritual staff.
4222  A mask crafted from the polished bones of a cruel Prefecturan noble. The Witch Doctor wears this mask when he wants influential spirits to take notice of his work.
4223  The head of Witch Doctor's mother hangs from this staff. Such a loving son.
4138  The inside is reinforced and padded to protect against heavy blows. 
4139  The added weight reminds the wearer of what he fights for, and the costs of failure.
4130  The darkest deeps hold many extinct skulls.
4131  When it fell to the depths and smashed a favorite coral bed, the Tidehunter swore to reunite the device with its owner.
4132  Nobody is certain whether this display means the Tidehunter is angry or in heat.  Either way, none have survived to ask.
4133  Axe cares nothing for the great castles and mighty holds of his enemies. He shatters their stanchions and crumbles their columns, transforming the rubble into weapons of war.
4134  A warrior as large as Axe rarely finds armor that fits. Often it is more practical to simply tie together bits of stone and metal.
4135  Armor crafted from the rubble of a conquered civilization.
4136  A helm worn by the footmen of an empire crushed by Axe long ago.
4137  Successful dragon knights boast few scars. The ones that get hit rarely live long.
4044  Celebrate a critical push or an enemy team wipe with this spidery dance.  Equip the item and bind a key to the 'Taunt Item' button to use.
4040  Spirits are afraid of snakes, too.
4043  Axe requests more fools to slaughter! Equip the item and bind a key to the 'Taunt Item' button to use.
4049  So often did Krobelus attempt to pass beyond the veil of death that those whose time had ended begged the chance with return her.
4549  Carved from the corewood of a five-thousand-year-old-tree, this magnificent brings an ancient strength to any battle.
4548  A hairstyle common to the Zaru'Kina people of Windrunner's destroyed village.
4541  Ozh acha domosh ahm'omoz!
4540  This new item has no description.
4545  To harness the powers of the burning nether requires a symbol feared for its malice.
4544  To look past reality and view the vile powers beyond requires vision and clarity surpassing most mortal means.
4547  As the face upon the belt gleams in the sun, so too do the emeralds in its eyes.  The honors of the Golden Mane are valuable beyond measure.
4546  The ring would scorch the very soul of the wearer were it not placed on a finger already beyond hope.
4534  Birot of the Deep Waters, than whom no lord is more dignified, grants a portion of his dignity to his favored Morphling, in the form of stately crests.
4535  Wielding this immense weapon, Bradwarden slashes and crushes all those in his wake.
4536  Morphling proudly sports the polished and most dignified helm of Birot, who knows nothing of the dry surface world except what Morphling tells him.
4537  From darkness, the comet came carrying the wotery essence of Morphling. As it fell, a searing crown marked its encounter with the atmosphere. Morphling wears it now.
4823  Yasha, one of two legendary moonblades, is said to take on a form that best matches its owner's chosen martial art. In the hands of Riki this weapon takes the blade of a small, well balanced dagger.
4435  For those who doubt the Omniscient One's peaceful nature, one look at this weapon proves that doubt well deserved.
4434  They're not fancy, but they keep the hands warm.
4437  Beyond time lie stones and crystals forever able to bestow incredible power.  As these crystals leave their stasis, a growth that has never before known the temporal flow begins to take hold.
4436  With this lantern Warlock peers into the shadows of death itself.  Death shrinks from the light.
4431  A thousand lives it claimed before it shattered, and a thousand more it shall claim after!
4430  A thousand lives it claimed before it shattered, and a thousand more it shall claim after!
4433  Coming through! Even Juggernaut will leap to avoid the icy edges of these lethal armlets.
4432  Forged for a brutal warlord who sought to challenge Axe in single combat.
4533  Blades so sharp, they might cut the very fabric of one's mind.
4439  This stone spear seems old and chipped, yet this heirloom is still very sturdy.
4438  For those times when giving someone the cold shoulder is only the beginning.
4945  Ah, to be young again.  This haircut should help!
4944  When you're just starting out, your formulas are a little braver, a little less precise.  And a lot more dangerous.
4947  What it may lack for vision it makes up for in protection.
4946  If you're gonna work with unstable materials, make sure you can survive a mistake!
4941  In the fragmentary legends of the Ancient Sovereign, death by such claws was something greatly to be desired.
4940  Unearthed from the sand-scoured ruins of El'Harath, from this Visage the entire culture of the Sovereign has been resurrected.
4943  The ancients glided stealthily above the sands in ages when these wings were not yet vestigial.
4942  Sandking pays tribute to the Ancient Sovereign with every step.
4949  The moon shines with mystic lustre on Mirana's forearms...or is it the glow of these polished bracers?
4948  Good for stirring mixtures, great for chopping dinner!

10018 "How did I get here?" Such words of power are commonly heard from Dolfrat the Wizard, whose magic is so great that even he cannot grasp it. Indeed, his enemies accuse him of having no magical training whatsoever, pointing to the evidence of his most frequent incantation: "Did I do that?" And should you ever spy the mighty Dolfrat flat on his back in the road, you can be sure his trusty steed Roshinante is somewhere nearby--probably galloping at top speed away from a creaky tree or shadow that resembled a demon of nightmarish power.

Here, where snow had never fallen, Rylai spent months in deep meditation, mastering her powers, before waking one afternoon with a single frigid word upon her lips: 'Snowdrop!' For a moment, the steam that filled the air turned to ice, and the warm precipitation became a softly falling snow. When she returned to her old teacher, she found him waiting with a smile, fully aware of the magic she had wrought, as he presented her this outfit to show her worth and mastery. Contains all of the items in the 'Snowdrop' set for Crystal Maiden:
20085 On the trail of a curious cipher which might decrypt an ancient codex of the Hidden Temple, Lanaya stumbled upon a cache of hidden garments in an arboretum sacred to the Three Shades. Three garments, wrapped in the petals of an enormous nightshade, on which were inscribed the names of those ethereal Shades that lent their attributes to each piece: madness, terror and death. Most would consider these poor qualities in their attire. But for Templar Assassin, donning the Deadly Nightshade is an accelerant to wisdom. Includes all of the items in 'The Deadly Nightshade' set for Templar Assassin:

4440  Crystal Maiden hardly needs to keep her hands warm in freezing weather. We suspect these are strictly a fashion statement.

4443  Constructed from the scales and teeth of grand dragon Vyxia, her fiery blood still stains and heats the edge.

10004 It is rare to find a smeevil far from the warmth of the forge to which it's bound, for they thrive on the affectionate cuffings and curses of their sworn smith. But the lure of a free tortoiceros ride compelled the smeevil Murrissey to break every oath...
10005 Most boxhounds you're likely to come across would sooner eat you just for touching them, but all this little guy ever wants to do is play fetch.  His master never came home from battle, so if Lockjaw follows you home you should probably keep him.
10006 Why light a fire if you can't watch it burn?
10007 The beasts of Underwool are terrible bringers of death and destruction, demons of shadow afflicted by a black wizard's curse that has ensured they are forever cute and fluffy.

10002 May cause blindness.
10003 Discovered on an island in the Samareen Sea, this species of delicious dragon has been all but wiped out by hungry sailors.  Druffins lack the sense that nature gives most creatures, but their limitless trust makes them good couriers in the thick of battle.

4845  This armor weighs more than you do.  Behold, and marvel at the strength of Bradwarden.
4846  The mighty centaur needs no shield when protected by these durable bracers of Omexe.
4847  Many lives has this mighty flail ended.  Many skulls has this mighty flail pulped.
4840  Twisted is the mind that broods beneath these twisted horns. Twisted are the intentions that issue from that mind. Twisted is the fate of those who encounter Leshrac.
4841  Rumors have it that Leshrac once lost his tail, and after much searching and despair, an artificial appendage was attached. Perhaps this was the source of his bleak brand of wisdom.
4842  Some insights are so painful that they burst out from within, piercing flesh, filling body and mind alike with agonizing insight.
4843  They say that wisdom grows not without bright light, fresh air, clean water. But a twisted sort of wisdom, like these vines, may feed and thrive on anguish, black thoughts, and foul deeds.
4937  Many experiments were required, and challenges overcome, to craft material able weather Lina's flame.

Armor he promised her, the finest in the land, if only she would set him free. And so a deal was struck, and the blacksmith measured, and toiled, taking as his materials the finest steel to be found among the husked corpses of silk-wrapped knights.

20100 In the final years of the Sordid Era, after thirteen seasons of drought, shamanic ways fell into disrepute, with all itinerant mages blamed for failing crops and disease. In order to continue his travels, Rhasta was forced to adopt a new appearance. While still offering many of the same services, during the end of this Era he disclaimed all knowledge of shamanism and professed only the knowledge that any vagabond might acquire along the road, and practice (in a strictly nonprofessional sense) for a few coins. Thus he survived into the next era, when many another was separated from their hide and stretched out along the roads as a warning to the next shaman who might happen along. Contains all of the items in the 'Mysterious Vagabond' set for Shadow Shaman:
20101 Long ago exiled from the valleys of Knollen, Sniper has travelled to many lands, fought in many battles, and learned much along the way.

4613  The guardians of the forest paths walk in perfect silence, betrayed not by their cunning footwear.
4612  A sword made from the talons of a fallen wyvern.
4615  Let this blade guard you from harm.
4614  The go-to mallet for when your enemies absolutely, positively must be smited.
4617  Kunkka's ship cleaves the waves as easily as Finblade cleaves his enemies. Kunkka revels in the iridiscent play of light given off by dashing spray and liberated souls alike.
4616  Off the coast near the village of Pole are fish large enough to eat a man in a single bite.  Against such a beast, a spear simply will not do.

4468  The measured thud of this staff may be heard in the labyrinthine corridors of the Ultimyr Archives as often as these ominous words: "Now where did I put that book?"

4466  Astride the last of the legendary archtyrex, a skilled stormcrafter channels the fury of the storm itself.
4467  As the peregrine flies, so too shall this blade.

4462  Armor made from the likeness of a fallen drake.
4463  Made from the finest crushed and reconstituted dragon-hardened shell, the Traveler's Jug has for generations been thought unbreakable.  Now Brewmaster puts it to the test.

4868  A hood to cover a wizened head and keep dark thoughts away.
4869  If our world is but a shadow of Barathrum's real world, then this belt may be but a shadow of Spirit Breaker's real belt. But oh what a shadow! 
4862  Some have questioned the fashion sense of using a skull for a belt buckle.  The last guy who questioned it became a second belt buckle.
4863  That's not an eye-patch.  That's armor for his vision.
4860  For some heroes, a shoulder isn't a deadly weapon capable of eviscerating enemies.  Lycan isn't one of those heroes.  
4861  Even his arms are armed.
4866  White as the light of the hottest supernova, and gold as any royal coin, this is a vestment truly worthy of a Fundamental.
4867  On a pale horse he rides, this spark of endless suns, this Keeper of the Light.
4864  What is a warhorse without a little pomp and barding?  These golden coverings are a mark of distinction on any field of battle.
4865  With this radiant staff Keeper of the Light has sparked the heat of endless suns.  
4484  Although forged from silver and jeweled with crimsonstone, this enchanted Shield of the Drake is no ornamental bauble to hefted at tourneys.  It is the deepest kind of magic, and its bearer could find no better protection.
4485  The massive shoulders of Omniknight bear this armor well.
4486  Among the many weapons in the Crimson Cut-throat's home were a trio of small, curved knives which Gondar repurposed into a new shuriken.
4487  It has been long since this apparel has been seen in the great halls of the Slithereen, but few have forgotten it.
4480  Wings woven with the silk of the Deep Ruby Spider. Adorned at the tips with the gems hewn from the spider's body.
4481  A carapaced lord of the deepest flooded oceans of the world, Birot pays tribute to water's finest representative on land.
4482  Nine lances were left on the field for the nine royal guardsmen slain in the final battle against the Dread Magus.
4483  This one is gonna sting a little.  Oh, yes.
4488  The warlord thought his forged armor would win the day.  Axe showed him otherwise.
4489  Though crafted in symbolic likeness to the great wheel books of the ruined city, the Spade of the Gluttonous whistles no song but the song of death.
89    This new item has no description.
4260  Bracers that infuse the living waters with Radiant essence. When fighting for the Dire, Morphling wears them with purely ironic intent.
4261  The promise of a Radiant crown was enough to draw from its path the frozen comet in which Morphling waited to take watery form.
4262  Plucked from the deeps of a still mountain pool, it was as if these pauldrons had waited an eternity to be discovered by the one fated to wear them.
4263  Morphling's terrifying charge is made all the more intimidating when he bristles with these stunning Radiant crests.
4264  While a stopped clock may be right on occasion, savage deployment of the Timebreaker is always appropriate.
4265  The name of the ancient kingdom that fell to this terrible blade has long been forgotten to history.  The blade itself, however, seems impossible to lose track of. 
4266  Omniknight wears such armaments proudly.
4267  Omniknight wears his feelings on his sleeve.  That and a blue bracer, which he'll use to smite his enemies in the name of the Omnicient.
4268  When your best tool is a hammer, the world (and the head of the heretic) begins to look like a nail.
4269  For Omniknight, no show of loyalty is too great.
4916  A ceremonial belt of leather and brass meant to signify the high status of the wearer.
4917  Braced for combat.
4666  To give riches is torture.  To take riches is bliss.
15099 atoD 2 features 8 top North American and European teams. Using Reverse Captain's Mode, teams will surely play unconventional heroes and sabotage each other's lineups.  With some of the proceeds going to the prize it's the first tournament to include a direct way for fans to increase the prizepool.
4912  It used to open some ancient triumphal arch, but the structure was damaged during excavation.  Using explosives probably didn't help.
4913  A backpack, a cloak, the finest blanket you can steal, and a little souvenir for a discerning ruffian.
15152 The inaugural E2Max L33T Championship (ELC) will feature a prize pool of SGD13,000 cash. online and LAN qualifiers from May to July, with the Grand Finals on 7th July at E2Max, Cineleisure, Singapore!

4662  Upon the shoulder sits a coiled snake, wrought in gold. The seers of Serpent Clan often read the future in the entrails of their lowly kin.
4911  Once in a while you find bandits living in the ruins.  Once in a while they forget things while they're being evicted.
4008  A helm bearing the cyclopean visage of the Tarnsmen's demonic war god. It is said the Red Mist destroyed the god and took its symbols for their own.
4009  Heavy platemail forged in the blood of the Tarnsmen's dead gods.
4000  The bleached satyr horn mounted atop this mask is said to allow the wearer to channel an ancestor's power.

4002  Witch Doctor found this stylish croc jaw discarded in the bush.
4003  Witch Doctor carries the ribs of his old grandfather, a shaman who held powerful magicks and spoke with influential spirits. Grandfather offers the Witch Doctor access to power in exchange for the opportunity to see blood spilled once more.
4004  A three section chained haft with double bladed axe head at the top. Nearly as dangerous to it's wielder as it is to the enemy.
4005  If your ineffable transdimensional power over chronology fails to stop your enemy, try hitting them in the head with this sturdy mace.
4006  A carefully assembled collection of troll's teeth. Each tooth contains the trapped soul of its former owner.
4007  The claw from a black dragon's left toe. The only piece of the beast that survived an encounter with Pudge's voracious hunger.

4713  At the height of the ceremony of Qaz'hallaq, seven virtuous acolytes are stung to death with one swipe of this malevolent armored appendage.
4718  The grim visage of the Bramble Lord adorns the deflector.
4719  The Bramble Lord insisted that all arms made in his honor be just as adept at piercing as they were at tearing.
4479  A faded alloy ring attracts static electricity.
4478  Caring for a repository of singular, priceless, unreproducible volumes of wisdom and madness is a burden that, like this mantle, may be shouldered by only an Archivist of similarly singular power.
4471  Said to be forged from the iron that once chained the last of the great Drakinds, this helm is most coveted among dragon slayers.
4470  Prevents cranial intrusions by a particularly pernicious form of bookwyrm that skulks in the Ultimyr Archives.
4473  Having a bad hair day?  No problem.  This snappy little markswoman's cap is stylish for all occasions.
4472  "All Who Borrow Must Return" is the Archivist's slogan. Those who do not return what they borrow are soon visited by that which resides in this bag.
4475  Certain tomes in the Ultimyr Archives have never seen the light of day, and never will. But their pages have seen this light many times.
4474  Resistant to mold, mildew, cobwebs, curses and other things which make perusing the Ultimyr Archives dangerous to even experienced browsers.

4679  Few sorcerers can claim to own a shawl that appears as prestigious as it is fire resistant.
4678  The Wildwing are fierce and territorial, but they more than tolerate Enchantress in their realms: They welcome her.
4901  A billowing sleeve for Spectre, charged with the excess energy that overflows from Spectre's present form.  
4676  The Wildwings treasure their lost feathers, saving them to line the nests where they raise their young. It speaks of their deep respect for Enchantress that they gifted her these feathers for her bangles.
4903  A dress, slightly tattered by the constant flux of spectral energy. 
4902  Chaotic emanations from a plane of violent power are conducted through these focal-horns and imbue Spectre with energy.
4904  Named after a legendary dragon, this sword was given to the Juggernaut on the day he became a swordmaster.
4907  The bones of those who came before are brought to the field of battle once more.

4019  A weathered, hooked harpoon and heirloom of Kunkka's line.
4018  A well crafted tricorne edged in gold.
4013  This is merely a bracer of fur. It has no particular aspect of interest and offers no magical protections. Still, it bears a great name and in so doing illustrates the hollowness of baseless pride.

4011  A lost foot does not hinder Kunkka's desire for vengeance.

4703  The crest of the Tahlin Watch sits upon the brow.
4702  When death is the price, one can never swing too many blades.
4701  A cloak is every traveler's friend.  A warm covering for the cold, and it confuses the silhouette, making the wearer a more difficult target at long range. 
4700  These shoulder pads provide protection against both the enemy, and the occasional bruised shoulder of the long-distance shootist.
4709  A cloak crafted from the feathers and talons of the stormcrow.

4649  Those who practiced the magical arts are often feared for their power.
4642  On the world at the rim grow a species of crystalline tree in whose branches visions of the future are tangled. From such a tree, Outworld Devourer fashioned this staff.
4643  "And why shouldn't I?" Drow has been heard to say, to absolutely no one.
4640  Demnok studied for years to construct the true name of the Watcher, hoping to bind a creature powerful enough to know and reveal the Ozkavosh tongue.  Unfortunately, the Watcher lacks a tongue.
4641  A helm whose very symmetry foreshadows the dark power that Harbinger may summon to protect the inmost shells of creation from cold destructive forces beyond knowing.
4646  Gotta dig deep if you want to find the best!
4644  Style and sorcery are said to go hand in hand.
4645  The moon's lustre fills these bracers, and fills Mirana with midnight power.

4391  There is no edge so keen as the edge of a dragon slayer's sword.
